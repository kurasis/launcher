# Implementation progress

This tracker is intentionally initialized as **not_started**. Creating the specification does not implement any application feature. The coding agent updates this file in place at `SPEC_ROOT/PROGRESS.md` (recommended repository `docs/spec/PROGRESS.md`). Keep it beside PHASES.md so relative links work; do not maintain a second tracker.

Allowed states: `not_started`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `done`. A partially implemented phase stays `in_progress` or `blocked`; use Notes to distinguish finished code from missing live verification.

| Phase | Status | Evidence / commit | Blocker / notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [P01](phases/P01-PROJECT-FOUNDATION.md) | in_progress | Local checks pass on Ubuntu 24.04 host; see [VERIFICATION.md](../VERIFICATION.md#p01--project-foundation) | Waiting for CI on the pull request |
| [P02](phases/P02-CORE-STORAGE-AND-IPC.md) | not_started | — | — |

## External dependencies

| Dependency | State | Required owner contribution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project-owned Microsoft public client and service access | Not supplied (tracked in [AUTH-SETUP.md](../AUTH-SETUP.md); does not block P01–P03, P05–P08) | Supply registered client ID and confirm accepted auth configuration/access |
| Real owned / no-access / active subscription test accounts | Unverified | Owner-operated tests; never put credentials into this file |
| Target OS/hardware test environments | Only an Ubuntu 24.04 container host and GitHub-hosted CI runners are available; no target desktops (see [VERIFICATION.md](../VERIFICATION.md#test-environments)) | Identify available Windows, macOS Intel/arm64 and Linux sessions |
| Release identity and signing | Provisional identity `io.github.kurasis.launcher` / "Kurasis Launcher" ([D-001](../DECISIONS.md#d-001--provisional-application-identity)); no signing | Choose stable app identity and supply signing configuration when distributing |

## Last completed phase report

None. Implementation has not started.

## Decisions / deviations

Record deliberate changes with reason, impacted FR/G/A identifiers and verification evidence. Never silently shrink supported platforms or waive missing tests.

## Required final account evidence

| Acceptance | Live result | Phase responsible |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A03: own-client positive authentication | Unverified | P04; reconfirm at P13 |
| A04: actual no-access account denied | Unverified | P13; may be collected in P04 |
| A05: active subscription accepted | Unverified | P13; may be collected in P04 |
| A06: profile/setup and service failures | Unverified | P13; fixtures start in P04 |

P04's local completion criteria and P13's final evidence requirements are distinct. See document 08. Specification version 1.2.1 changes documentation only; every implementation phase remains not_started.
